# Inventory-Management-System - C Mini Project

The project aims at developing an inventory management system using the C language that enables an organization to maintain its inventory.

The project inventory management system demonstrates the creation of a user interface of a system, without the use of C Graphics library. The application uses basic C functions to generate menus, show message boxes and print text on the screen. To display customized text with colors and fonts according to application requirements, functions have been created in the application, which fetch the exact video memory addresses of a target location, to write text at the particular location.

The application also implements the concept of structures to define the inventory items. It also effectively applies the various C concept, such as file operations, looping and branching constructs and string manipulation functions.
